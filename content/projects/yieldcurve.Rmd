**The inverted yield curve**

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).

We are accessing [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates for the US, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/).

First, we will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol = tickers,
                     var = myvars, 
                     maturity = maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% 
  tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

Our dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

**Plotting the yield curve**

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1_re,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.height=8}
maturity_name <- c(
  '3m'='3-Month Treasury Bill',
  '6m'='6-Month Treasury Bill',
  '1y'='1-Year Treasury Rate',
  '2y'='2-Year Treasury Rate',
  '3y'='3-Year Treasury Rate',
  '5y'='5-Year Treasury Rate',
  '7y'='7-Year Treasury Rate',
  '10y'='10-Year Treasury Rate',
  '20y'='20-Year Treasury Rate',
  '30y'='30-Year Treasury Rate'
)

ggplot(yield_curve,aes(x=date,y=price))+
  geom_line(aes(color=maturity))+
  facet_wrap(~maturity,nrow=5,labeller=as_labeller(maturity_name))+
  labs(y = "%",
       x = NULL,
       title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)"
         ) +

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

```{r yield_curve_2_re,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.height=8,fig.width=12}
yield_curve2 <- yield_curve %>% 
  mutate(year=year(date),month=month(date)) %>% 
  filter(year>=1999)

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3_re,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.width=12}
yield_curve3 <- yield_curve %>% 
  mutate(year=year(date),month=month(date)) %>% 
  filter(year>=1999) %>% 
  filter(maturity == '3m' | maturity == '10y')
  


ggplot(yield_curve3,aes(x=date,y=price))+
  geom_line(aes(color=var))+
  labs(y = "%",
       x = NULL,
       title = "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",size=15),
         axis.title.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12)
        )+
  NULL

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. In this graph, it seems that every recession since 1960s has been preceded by a yield curve inversion. But yield curve inversion doesn't always precede a recession. For instance, in the second half of 1966 and 2019 the yield curve inverted but a recession didn’t closely follow. Since 1999, short-term yield was higher than longer term debt in 2000.8-2000.12, 2006.8-2007.4, 2019.6-2019.9 and 2020.2.
