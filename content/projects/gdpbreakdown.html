<p><strong>GDP components over time and among countries</strong></p>
<p>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are <em>Personal Consumption</em> (C), <em>business investment</em> (I), <em>government spending</em> (G) and <em>net exports</em>. You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator <code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</code> in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.</p>

<p>The last chart compares the GDP breakdown structure of its four components. In all of the four countries, household expenditure contributes the most part with around 60-70% of the GDP composed of the household expenditure, while the net export made up of the least past in the total GDP number, contributing to less than 10% of the total GDP.</p>
<p>Looking closely into each country, there are different dynamics as well. For Germany, the contribution proportion of household expenditure is the lowest among the three countries, and it demonstrated a declining trend over the recent three decades. It is also the only country among the three that had constant trend of declining proportion of gross capital formation in these three countries, and the percentage number declined by about 10% in the past 50 years. On the other hand, Germany is also the only country that had a increase in the proportion of the net exports. While the other two countries both have negative contribution of net export, around 8% of the current GDP in German in made up of the net export. This is mainly because of its strong manufacturing industry that supported the export data.</p>
<p>In India, the household expenditure started as more than 70% of the GDP in 1970, and the number has continuously decreased to about 55% in 2016. On the other hand, India’s gross capital formation greatly increased over the years to account for 35% of the total GDP in 2016, which is the highest percentage in the three countries. This shows that India is quickly accumulating capital over the years. India also had the lowest government expenditure, constantly contributing to around 10% of the total GDP.</p>
<p>In the United States, the most noticeable difference is that the household expenditure is continuously taking up more part of the total GDP, and the percentage is the highest in the 2016 among the three countries. Another difference is the government expenditure, which largely decreased from 25% to 15%.</p>
