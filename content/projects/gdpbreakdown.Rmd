**GDP components over time and among countries**

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are *Personal Consumption* (C), *business investment* (I), *government spending* (G) and *net exports*. You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6).

```{r read_GDP_data, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet = "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip = 2) # Number of rows to skip

```

First step: Tidying the data:

```{r reshape_GDP_data, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

tidy_GDP_data  <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
# make the data into longer version
    pivot_longer(cols = -c(1:3),
               names_to = "Year", 
               values_to = "USD"
               )%>% 
# express figures into billions
 mutate(USD_bn = USD/1e9) %>% 
  
# rename the indicators into shorter names
 mutate(ShortName = case_when(
    IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Government expenditure",
    IndicatorName =="Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports",
    IndicatorName =="Imports of goods and services" ~ "Imports",
    IndicatorName =="Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household expenditure",
    IndicatorName =="Gross Domestic Product (GDP)" ~ "GDP",
    
    TRUE ~ as.character(IndicatorName)
  ))


glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
# select the countries
country_list <- c("Germany", "India","United States")

# select only the required components of GDP
indicator_list <- c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports")

# select data only for selected countries & indicators
graph1_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country  %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(ShortName %in% indicator_list)

```

After this is done, letÂ´s have a look at the specific GDP components for Germany, India and the United States.

```{r gdp1_rep}

ggplot(data=graph1_data, aes(x=Year, y= USD_bn,group=ShortName))+
  
#plot the lines by indicator names
  geom_line(aes(color=ShortName))+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1970,2010,by=10))+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle="In constant 2010 USD",
       x= '', 
       y = "Bilion US$",
       caption = "Source: United Nations,https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads") +
  
  #add legend to the graph
  guides(color=guide_legend(title="Components of GDP"),size=5)+

    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, margin=margin(0,15,0,0)),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8, margin = margin(15,0,0,0)),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold", margin = margin(0,0,5,0)),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8, margin = margin(0,0,20,0)),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=8, face="bold"),
        plot.caption =  element_text(size = 6),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 8))+
  NULL
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

```{r gdp2_rep}
library(scales)
# select the required components of GDP, and GDP
indicator_list2 <- c("Gross capital formation", "Exports", "Government expenditure", "Household expenditure", "Imports","GDP")

# select data only for selected countries & indicators
graph2_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country  %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(ShortName %in% indicator_list2)

# delete the columns of orginal names and USD amount
graph2_data<- subset(graph2_data, select = -c(USD,IndicatorName)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = ShortName, values_from = USD_bn) 

#replace the space in column names 
colnames(graph2_data) <- gsub(" |/", '_', colnames(graph2_data)) 

#Calculate net exports and the breakdown of GDP
graph2_data1<-graph2_data %>% 
  mutate(Net= Exports-Imports,
         GovExp_percent=Government_expenditure/GDP,
         Net_percent=Net/GDP,
         GrossCap_percent=Gross_capital_formation/GDP,
         HouseExp_percent=Household_expenditure/GDP,
         GDP_Calculated=Net+Gross_capital_formation+Government_expenditure+Household_expenditure,
         GDP_difference= GDP_Calculated/GDP-1)

# Display the % difference between what calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe
gdp_diff<-graph2_data1 %>% 
 pivot_longer(cols = -c(1:3),
              names_to = "ShortName", 
              values_to = "GDP_Difference"
               )%>% 
  filter(ShortName =="GDP_difference")

gdp_diff<-gdp_diff %>% 
  mutate(GDP_difference_percent=scales::percent(GDP_Difference))
print(subset(gdp_diff,select=-c(GDP_Difference)))

# select only the required data for comparison
indicator_list3 <- c("GovExp_percent", "Net_percent","GrossCap_percent","HouseExp_percent")

#make the dataframe into longer version
graph2_data2<-graph2_data1 %>% 
 pivot_longer(cols = -c(1:3),
               names_to = "ShortName", 
               values_to = "USD_bn"
               )%>% 
  filter(ShortName %in% indicator_list3)

#plot the result

ggplot(data=graph2_data2,aes(x=Year, y= USD_bn,group=ShortName))+
  
#plot the lines by indicator names
  geom_line(aes(color=ShortName))+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1970,2010,by=10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,0.2,0.4,0.6),labels=c("0.0%","20.0%","40.0%","60.0%"))+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US dollars",
       x= '', 
       y = "Bilion US$",
       caption = "Source: United Nations,https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads") +

      legend.text = element_text(size = 8))+
  NULL
```

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

As shown in the above table, the percentage difference is quite small and mostly less than 5%.


> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 
 
The last chart compares the GDP breakdown structure of its four components. In all of the four countries, household expenditure contributes the most part with around 60-70% of the GDP composed of the household expenditure, while the net export made up of the least past in the total GDP number, contributing to less than 10% of the total GDP.

Looking closely into each country, there are different dynamics as well. For Germany, the contribution proportion of household expenditure is the lowest among the three countries, and it demonstrated a declining trend over the recent three decades. It is also the only country among the three that had constant trend of declining proportion of gross capital formation in these three countries, and the percentage number declined by about 10% in the past 50 years. On the other hand, Germany is also the only country that had a increase in the proportion of the net exports. While the other two countries both have negative contribution of net export, around 8% of the current GDP in German in made up of the net export. This is mainly because of its strong manufacturing industry that supported the export data.

In India, the household expenditure started as more than 70% of the GDP in 1970, and the number has continuously decreased to about 55% in 2016. On the other hand, India's gross capital formation greatly increased over the years to account for 35% of the total GDP in 2016, which is the highest percentage in the three countries. This shows that India is quickly accumulating capital over the years. India also had the lowest government expenditure, constantly contributing to around 10% of the total GDP.

In the United States, the most noticeable difference is that the household expenditure is continuously taking up more part of the total GDP, and the percentage is the highest in the 2016 among the three countries. Another difference is the government expenditure, which largely decreased from 25% to 15%.
