      <description>… where it all started
Dear Visitor,
my name is Luca Schiek and I am the creator of this page. I am 22 years old and was born in Krefeld, Germany. During my high school years at the Gymnasium am Moltkeplatz, I socially engaged in the student-run humanitarian initiative Moltke für Afrika e.V. and played competitive tennis @HTC Blau-Weiß Krefeld.

      <description>We will use the tidyquant package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns.
The file nyse.csv contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker symbol, name, the IPO (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.
nyse &amp;lt;- read_csv(here::here(&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;nyse.csv&amp;quot;)) First, we want to get have a look at the industries the companies are operating in. Therefore, we create bar plot that shows as how many companies are in each industry.</description>
